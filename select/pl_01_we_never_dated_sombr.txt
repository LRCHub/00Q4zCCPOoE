You were clever,
knew when to deliver your lines
And make it seem like
you weren't that bright
You were better in every way
by design
You were too good for
a man's confine
How come we never even dated
But I still find myself
thinking of you daily?
Why do you always leave
me achin'
When you were never mine for
the takin'?
I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
Babe, I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
Babe, I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
You are a pretty one,
nice to romanticize
But you don't make yourself
easy to like
You like to have your fun,
you dance around the line
Of what is wrong and what
is right
How come we never even dated
But I still find myself
thinking of you daily?
Why do you always leave
me achin'
When you were never mine for
the takin'?
I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
Babe, I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
Babe, I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
I wish nothing but the best
for you
But I hope who's next sees
the rest of you
How come we never even dated
But I still find myself
thinking of you daily?
(Still find myself thinking
of you)
Why do you always leave
me achin'
When you were never mine for
the takin'?
(When you were never mine
for the takin')
How come we never even dated
But I still find myself
thinking of you daily?
(Still find myself thinking
of you)
Why do you always leave
me achin'
When you were never mine for
the takin'?
I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
Babe, I can't make you love me
No, I can't make you love me
