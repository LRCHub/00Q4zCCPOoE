and your split lip kissing routine slipped listless on the crowd christmas light parade
lights up porous hands and mouths and you're in the lambent evening
working weight shifts a chain gang of waves hit hands on hips
exhausted heat-chilled breaths to strong backs
and you're not starting any trends in the back seat of your father's car
back to bed, upstairs to the kitchen drawers
and my obsequious charm i'll wear my heart pinned to my back
so you can watch it break while i walk away
